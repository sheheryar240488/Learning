print("ACCESS TUPLE")
# You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets:
thisTuple = ("apple","banana","carrot")
print(thisTuple[1])

# Return the third, fourth, and fifth item:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
print(thistuple[2:5])
#Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).Remember that the first item has index 0.

#Check if "apple" is present in the tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
if "apple" in thistuple:
  print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits tuple")
