"""Python Numbers
There are three numeric types in Python:

int
float
complex"""

# Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:

x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

#Random number will generate every time you run between 10 and 20.

import random
print(random.randrange(10,20))
